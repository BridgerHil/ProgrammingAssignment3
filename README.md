so far so good, there's things that need to be fixed as goes:

1 - Figure out how to only select 3 cards and then check logic
2 - Figure out how to make it scrollable, so the player is able to see all the cards even at 81(full deck amount) 
3 - Fix Oval jankyness
4 - Maybe make the squiggle more squiggly
